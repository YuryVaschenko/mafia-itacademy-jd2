# Mafia. Final JD2 project.

Mafia JD2 is a facetious project about organization of mafia's work. The idea of project is that someone approved by any other registered Gotfather can register his own clan and became Godfather in it. Then he can hire a couple of caporegimes (team leaders), bunch of soldiers, divide them into groups and give them tasks. Gaporegimes can manage soldiers in their groups. All mafia members can enter in their own account and get information about their tasks or do other things depending on their role.

Used technologies: Spring MVC, Spring Security, Hibernate, Thymeleaf, JUnit, Log4j, HTML, CSS and little bit JavaScript and Yandex API.

This project is still in development.
